	Microrecognization is a light-weight microscope figure analysis tool based on OpenCV. This program can be used to analyze pores and cracks by converting the microscope figure to binary, counting the number of black pixels and analyzing the distribution of black connected areas.
	
Guidelines:
1. Run the env_config.cmd to build the runtime environment;
2. Run the Microrecognization.exe to run the program;
3. Input the figure captured by microscope and press Enter to confirm;
4. Input the threshold (0-255) to convert the figure to binary image, press Enter to confirm;
5. The program shows the binary image in a new window, press Space to continue after checking the binary image;
6. If the threshold is not suitable, input a new threshold, otherwise input <0 or >255 to continue;
7. Input function label to execute the function you want.
